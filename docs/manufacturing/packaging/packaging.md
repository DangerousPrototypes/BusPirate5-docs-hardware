import OldSiteWarning from '/old-site-warning.md'

## Finger Cots

To avoid fingerprints on the LCD and enclosure during assembly.

## Cable Tie
![](./img/velcro-10mm-400px.jpg)

A 5cm strip of 1cm wide Velcro strap holds the auxiliary cables together. Out of a lot of options like custom bags, cable clips, and cable wraps, this was the easiest and cheapest.

## Antistatic Bags

|Product|Zipless Bag|Tear Bag with Window|
|-|-|-|
|Bus Pirate 5 (PCB and enclosure)|9x12cm |9x13.5mm|
|Bus Pirate 5 (PCB only)|8x10cm|8x13cm|

Bus Pirate 5 is impulse sealed in an antistatic bag. We chose to seal the bag instead of using a zipper bag because the zipper part of the bag is annoying to fold neatly into the packaging. We attempted to find something recycled or biodegradable, but there weren't any readily available options in the market.

Bags with a pre-cut tear-open notch and a clear front window are significantly more expensive (0.049RMB vs 0.15RMB), but have a nicer all around feel.

## Zipper Bags
|Product|Zipper Bag|
|-|-|
|Probe/Auxiliary Cables|7x10cm|
|Button caps, bolts and 2mm Hex Wrench|4x6cm|

Zipper bags for cables and small parts.

## Cardboard Boxes

|Product|T Box|
|-|-|
|Bus Pirate 5 (PCB & enclosure, PCB only)|9x9x2cm (7.5x8.5x1.5cm inner)|
|Probe/Auxiliary Cables|7x7x2cm (5.5x6.5x1.5cm inner)|

At sizes this small, the T box type has a lot more strength than a small box but doesn't have as much interior space.

## Label Wraps

Custom printed boxes are always tempting, but the MOQ is high and they take up a lot of storage room. Cheap box printing isn't always pretty, and if something is wrong or needs to be changed there's a lot of waste.

Our approach is to use large "waist" bands typically wrapped around bento box takeaway food. This type of printing is super fast, super cheap and a really refined product. Custom shapes are generally lasercut for low volumes, so tooling fees are mostly a thing of the past. The red lines just outside the artwork indicate where the waists will be pre-folded to fit our boxes.
