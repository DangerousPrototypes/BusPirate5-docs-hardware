:::tip
There are two common footprints for SK6812-side-a. The preferred part has evenly spaced pads that bend 90 degrees and extend up the back of the part. We have had the best success reflow soldering this footprint, and it is MUCH easier to hand rework.
:::

Yes, the LED in the photo is badly oxidized. It was the only one we had on hand for the photo and it's been sitting out for over a year. Only new, packaged and protected LEDs should be used for manufacturing.

Example:

*   [SK6812-side-a](https://item.taobao.com/item.htm?spm=a1z09.2.0.0.1a572e8daQXham&id=630965496117&_u=j26q2r6f7f04)

_**Alternatives (requires PCB footprint change):**_

![](./img/led-sidea-bad.jpg)

This version of the SK6812-side-a has a slightly different footprint. We avoid it if possible.
:::warning
We had the following issues with this part:
*   Poor pick and place performance because the top of the package is at an angle
*   Poor reflow performance (>50% need hand rework)
*   Difficult to rework because the pads are hidden under the package
