:::tip
1K (R602, R603), 33K (R405, R604, R605), 102K (R403), 133K (R404) are used in analog circuits. Confirm they are 1% tolerance.

|R209|0805|33R|1|\>=1/10th Watts|5%|

Any standard 5% resistor can be used. This is a current limiting resistor for the LCD back-light, tolerance is not important. We've been using UniRoyal (UniOhm/RoyalOhm).

## Resistor 0.2R 1% 2W 2512

|-|-|-|-|-|-|
|R601|2512|0.2R|1|\>=2 Watts|1%, <=100ppm/C|

Any standard 1% 2512 package resistor can be used. It is best to have the lowest ppm/C possible. 50-100ppm/C is inexpensive and readily available.

*   Manufacturers: Any. We use Samsung.

Any standard quality capacitors rated for 10 volts or more can be used. 

:::warning
4.7uF is used with voltage regulators and should be a "low ESR" type with 2ohm or less ESR.

## Diode 1N4148 SOD-323

Standard 1N4148 diode, any manufacturer.

:::tip
Several manufacturers make a 1N4148 diode and also several of the transistors in this BOM. See the table in the Transistors and FETs section of the sourcing guide.

## Inductor 22uH 50mA+ 0603

|**Reference**|**Package**|**Value**|**Quantity**|**Rating**|**Note**|
|-|-|-|-|-|-|
|L100|0603|22uH|1|>=50mA (>=150mA surge)|

This inductor prevents brown out resets due to voltage level drop when an SD card is inserted into the socket. It should be 22uH (typically ~+/-25%) capable of 50mA current or greater. If there is a surge current rating it's best to look for >=150mA, but this isn't always specified and SD cards generally use well under 40mA. The other values are not critical.

**Any manufacturer is fine** if you can find it, this is an example:

* [MLZ1608M220WT000](https://item.szlcsc.com/356700.html) (TDK)

:::warning
TDK seems to be the only manufacturer of these high current miniature inductors in 0603. There are also wire wound inductors with a cute little "truth window" in the top: these are about half the price. However they are an exposed inductor coil and the RF effects may be an issue, so we chose not to FCC qualify with a cheaper part. We may look into it in the future, if only because it feels dirty to rely on a single supplier component in these times of uncertain supply chains.

## Ferrite Bead 1.5A 0805

|**Reference**|**Package**|**Value**|**Quantity**|**Rating**|**Note**|
|-|-|-|-|-|-|
|L201|0805|Ferrite bead|1|\>=1.5A|<100Ohms @ 100MHz|

This ferrite bead filters RF interference to/from the USB cable. The part must be rated for 1.5Amps or more, but the other values are not critical. Ideally it should have less than 100Ohms resistance at 100MHz (typically 15 or 30Ohms @ 100MHz). Tolerance is not important, typically +/-25%.

:::tip
The same bead used on the previous Bus Pirate versions will work.
