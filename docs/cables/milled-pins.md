# Milled Breadboard Pins

![](./img/pin-milled-v1.jpg)

Custom milled pins connect the Bus Pirate DuPont-style 2.54mm female connectors to a breadboard or pin header. We designed these little pins after searching for better way to connect to prototype boards and breakout headers, things that just don’t cooperate with probe hooks intended to grab onto IC legs.

Pins are milled from copper and then plated with nickel. Gold plating is an option, but gold is very soft and probably not worth the extra expense.
